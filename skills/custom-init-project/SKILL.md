## Tasks

1. **Analyze project**
   - Check for existing files (package.json, pyproject.toml, Cargo.toml, etc.)
   - Detect tech stack and framework
   - Check if Git repository

2. **Ask about sharing mode**

   Ask the user:
   ```
   How will you use CLAUDE.md in this project?

   1) Solo - Add to .gitignore (personal workflow, not shared)
   2) Team - Track in Git (shared context for all developers)
   ```

   - **Solo**: Add `CLAUDE.md` to `.gitignore`
   - **Team**: Keep `CLAUDE.md` tracked in Git

3. **Create CLAUDE.md**
   - Read template from `~/.claude/templates/CLAUDE.template.md`
   - Fill in detected project info
   - Add common development commands

4. **Create folder structure**
   - Create `docs/records/` if it doesn't exist
   - Create `docs/notes/` if it doesn't exist

5. **Update .gitignore**
   - Add `docs/notes/` to `.gitignore` (always, for private notes)
   - If Solo mode: Also add `CLAUDE.md` to `.gitignore`
   - Create `.gitignore` if it doesn't exist

6. **Git commit (if Git repo)**
   - Stage CLAUDE.md (if Team mode), .gitignore, and docs/records/
   - Commit: `chore: add CLAUDE.md project setup`

## Output

- Summary of what was created
- Detected tech stack
- Sharing mode (Solo/Team)
- Suggested next steps
